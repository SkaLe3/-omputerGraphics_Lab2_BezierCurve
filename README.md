# How to try:
1. Downloading the repository:
Start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/SkaLe3/KPI-ComputerGraphics-Labs
2. Generating solution:
After cloning run GenerateProjects.bat script file to generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution file
3. Select Startup project which you want to compile
## How to use:
### Bezier Curve Editor
1. All instructions provided in an application interface
### Bucket-Filling Tool
1. Select the image you want to fill on the Scene Hierarchy Panel
2. Select the algorithm and pick the color you want to use on the Settings Panel
3. Use the left mouse button to fill areas
### Fractals
1. Select the desired fractal, its color, and the number of iterations
2. Use WASD to navigate
3. Use the Mouse Wheel to zoom
4. Use the Left Mouse Button to regenerate the Barnsley Fern fractal

# About projects
  All projects were finished within a small amount of time each and the code quality is poor. The code needs to be refactored, optimized and finished to the end with the new architecture of an application. But there is no reason to refactor and finish because the essence is in the implementation of the idea of algorithms and in studying their work, and not in writing a high-quality software product. <br>
