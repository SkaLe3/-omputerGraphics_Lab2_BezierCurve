# ComputerGraphics-Labs
Laboratory work for Computer Graphics subject at KPI.
## Projects:
1. Bezier Curve Editor
2. Bucket-Filling Tool
   Algorithms used:
   * Flood Fill
   * Boundary Fill
   * Scanline Fill
   * Span Fill

# How to try:
1. Downloading the repository:
Start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/SkaLe3/KPI-ComputerGraphics-Labs
2. Generating solution:
After cloning run GenerateProjects.bat script file to generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution file
3. Select Startup project (Bezier Curve Editor is by default)
## How to use:
1. Select image you want to fill on Scene Hierarchy Panel
2. Select algorithm and pick color you want to use on Settings Panel
3. Use left mouse button to fill areas

# Time and quality
Both projects where finished within 15 hours each and the code quality is poor. The code needs to be refactored, optimized and finished to the end. But there is no reason to refactor and finish, because the essence is in the implementation of the idea of algorithms and in studying their work, and not in writing a high-quality software product.
 
# Framework used
Fully recoded clone of earlier version of TheCherno/Hazel with some custom changes
